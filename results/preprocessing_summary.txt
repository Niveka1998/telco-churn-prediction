Data Preprocessing Completed
============================

Original Dataset:
  - Rows: 7043
  - Columns: 21  (including customerID)

After Preprocessing:
  -Rows: 7043
  -Features: 19

Preprocessing Steps Applied:
  1.Handled 11 missing values in TotalCharges (median imputation)
  2.Removed 0 duplicate rows
  3.Dropped customerID (non-informative)
  4.Encoded target variable (Yes->1, No->0)
  5.Encoded 15 categorical features (Label Encoding)
  6.Scaled all features (StandardScaler: mean=0, std=1)
  7.Split data (80% train, 20% test) with stratification
  8.Applied SMOTE to balance training data

Final Dataset Shapes:
  - Training Features (X_train): (8278, 19)
  - Training Labels (y_train): (8278,)
  - Test Features (X_test): (1409, 19)
  - Test Labels (y_test): (1409,)

Class Distribution:
  - Original: 5174 No Churn, 1869 Churn
  - Training (Before SMOTE): 4139 No Churn, 1495 Churn
  - Training (After SMOTE): 4139 No Churn, 4139 Churn
  - Test (Unchanged): 1035 No Churn, 374 Churn
